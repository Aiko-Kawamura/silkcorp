- As part of our ongoing efforts to expand the reach and impact of SILK, we have an area of media channel dedicated to promoting our core values
of Strength, Intelligence, Love, and Kindness. 
- This area could take the form of a blog, article, or video series, and would provide a platform for us to share our ideas, insights, and experiences
 with a wider audience.
- Images should be high-quality, relevant, and in line with our core values, be visually appealing and help to convey the message of the content.
- Also, change the logo.png behind the content relevant to the SILK media.
